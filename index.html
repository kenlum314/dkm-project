						Introduction
					</h2>
					<p> 
						This project came about as the members met and realized their fantastic background 
						in new technology, could really help a BCIT teacher rebrand a 
						<a href="http://www.bcitcomp.ca/1950/">course website</a> he had 
						been perfecting. All members attended the same class where the teacher(Jeff Parker) 
						taught them about web development using HTML/5, CSS/3, jQuery and other related 
						technology. However one day they were discussing with Jeff how out of date his 
						course web site was, Jeff who was rather startled by the suggestion (but not insulted), 
						quickly mentioned that he was planning on making their final assignment one that 
						would could potentially completely replace the current website. In fact Jeff offered a 
						monetary reward to any team of students who could create a better website that met ALL 
						his criteria for improvement. That is how Project DKM came about rebranding the “COMP 
						1950 Intermediate Web Design and Development” website, coming in first place,  passing 
						the course with flying colors, collecting the prize money, and forever basking in the 
						limelight of BCIT web developers everywhere.
