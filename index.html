						Introduction
					</h2>
					<p> 
						This project came about as the group members (David, Ken, and Manny; a.k.a. DKM) met and
                        realized their fantastic backgrounds could really help a BCIT instructor redesign a
						<a href="http://www.bcitcomp.ca/1950/">course website</a> he had 
						been using. All members attended the same class where the instructor (Jeff Parker)
						taught them about web development using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, and other related
						technology. However one day they were discussing with Jeff how out-of-date his
						course web site was, and Jeff, who was rather startled by the suggestion (but not insulted),
						quickly mentioned that he was planning on making their final assignment one that 
						could potentially replace the current website. In fact, Jeff offered a
						monetary reward to any team of students who could create a better website that met ALL 
						his criteria for improvement. This website details how Project DKM came about and chronicles the
                        process by which the DKM group passed the course with flying colors, collected the prize money,
                        and forever became a legend amongst BCIT-trained web developers.

						Deliverables

                    <p>
                        <b>Manny</b><br/>
                        Responsible for creating the basic proto-site layout, coming up with the conceptual and responsive designs,
                        implementing the in-lecture links side panel, constructing the quiz page and buttons, and writing
                        the meta-site Introduction page, and being product manager, site reviewer, and client liaison. He also did
                        some of the SEO and gave feedback on styling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Ken</b><br/>
                        Responsible for setting up the GitHub repository and Google Docs collaboration tools, writing the meta-site Rationale page,
                        creating the preliminary sitemap, creating the resources and links page for the proto-site,
                        implementing the header navigation bar and the lecture navigation sidebar, and
                        wrote most of the jQuery and JavaScript code in the proto-site. He also did general refactoring (e.g. extracting and encapsulating
                        common code into SSIs in the proto-site) as well as SEO and was the main point of contact with the client.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Dave</b><br/>
                        Responsible for the basic meta-site layout, mobile navigation menu, and Introduction page. Continuously reviewed
                        and updated the site to ensure everything was in working order. He also integrated the 404 page,
                        did the course home page design, implemented the print/overhead stylesheets, performed SEO, and provided feedback
                        on styling.
