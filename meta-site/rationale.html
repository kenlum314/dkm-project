						Mentorship
					</h2>
					<p> 
						In 2010 I offered to help 
						<a href="http://www.bcitsa.ca/services/mentorship/">
							mentor a BCIT CST Student</a>
						in their half year program. I was excited to take part as I found my career quite 
						rocky through the dot-bomb and what has since followed. I have tried to stay in 
						touch with this individual as much as I felt would be welcome. Surprisingly I 
						found myself to be in a position of being a protege and mentored by some senior 
						engineering staff, from 2012-2015 for the cause of Internet/Web/Cloud Security.						
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2013 I offered to help SANS Mentor security concerned professionals with the 
						<a href="http://www.sans.org/course/web-app-penetration-testing-ethical-hacking">
							SANS 542: Web App Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking</a> 
						course. On a part-time basis I attempted to generate interest in the area of web 
						application security assessment (ie. legal and ethical hacking practices) in the 
						Vancouver Canada area, and market SANS as a source of training materials and 
						advice for interested parties. Generating interest in this space in the Vancouver 
						socio-economic market was not easy, and no official classes were held. I did 
						however make every attempt to explore how I could legitimize this market in the 
						Vancouver area and help others find the extra bit of training (and/or reputation) 
						required to enter into this particular area of technical work.

						Knowledge
					</h2>
					<p>
						There are so many resources for Network/Internet and Web/Cloud Security on the
						web that you can get lost in all of the information. Early on in my studies I 
						found <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/">NIST</a>,
						<a href="https://www.sans.org/">SANS</a>, and 
						<a href="https://www.mitre.org/publications/all">Mitre</a> very informative. 
						Many of their staff produced some great books and research material. As I tried 
						to describe security to software engineers I found the 
						<a href="https://buildsecurityin.us-cert.gov/">BSI</a>
						/ <a href="https://www.securecoding.cert.org">CERT</a> resources invaluable. When it 
						came to describing security	issues to the entire business I found 
						<a href="https://www.bsimm.com/">BSIMM</a>
						/ <a href="http://www.opensamm.org/">OpenSAMM</a> 
						very important. Here is a short list of some great materials I have found:					
						<ul>
							<li>
								<a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/">Common Weakness Enumeration</a> (CWE)
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures List</a> (CVE) 
							</li>						
							<li>
								<a href="http://www.sans.org/critical-security-controls/">Critical Security Controls</a> (CAG/CIP)

					<p>
						When it came to reviewing new research in the space certain academic research sites 
						became important to me, however in terms of consulting with real companies I have 
						found the work and support of 
						<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page">OWASP</a> to be quite compelling 
						in terms of communicating directly to Mobile/Web Application development groups 
						and/or staff. To be quite frank OWASP is much more in your face and can help create
						security awareness in development groups not just the management: To be honest given
						it is much harder today to have a silo role that does not involve technology decisions,
						I believe OWASP speaks to the heart of today's business in the software sector, with 
						a wide variety of materials and interfaces that provide members with the ability to 
						learn/contribute:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Appsec_Tutorial_Series">The App Sec Tutorial</a>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Podcast">Regular Interesting Podcasts</a>
								- <a href="https://soundcloud.com/owasp-podcast">New Series</a>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AppSec_Conference">Annual Conferences</a>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="http://2015.appsec.eu/">Research Conferences</a>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Project">Practical Projects</a>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page">Website Wiki</a>
							</li>							
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						It is also important to be able to challenge your local community concerning 
						the security concepts you are encountering. I have found the 
						<a href="http://www.securitybsides.com/w/page/12194156/FrontPage">Security B-Sides</a>
						conference an excellent place to receive new local incites and dialog with fellow
						security practicioners. The <a href="https://bsidesvancouver.com/">B-Sides Vancouver</a> 
						conference is also a great place to communicate 
						<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dbavedb/creating-developer-security-awareness">
						your own ideas</a> to a larger local community.
					</p>

					<h2>
						Local Dialog
					</h2>
					<p>
						Simply knowing about one or two specific security features (like 
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication">Authentication</a>,
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization_%28computer_access_control%29">Authorization</a>,
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting">Accounting</a>,
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function">Password Hashing</a>, and
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption">Encryption Algorithms</a>
						), might actually make
						you think you know alot, but knowing everything won't help you respond or 
						prevent incidents and/or attacks. If your looking to gain wisdom and not 
						just knowledge, you are	probably looking for the impossible not just the possible. 
						Preparing for the impossible is one of the reasons I started attending a local 
						security group called <a href="">VanCitySec</a>. VanCitySec isn't a group of 
						professionals in suits talking about how big/small their budget is, it's a group 
						of people that work in all aspects of Security Technology, and if you are looking 
						to ensure you have covered all the bases for your organization, it is something 
						you should seek to be a part of. I may have phrased this wrong, but that is the 
						purpose this groups serves for me. They won't just drill you on
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_policy">Policies</a>,
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_Profile">Profiles</a>,
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection_system">Intrusion Detection</a>,
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_prevention_system">Intrusion Prevention</a>, and
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security">Computer Security</a>, 
						often the discussion goes beyond the basics towards the principles of 
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_engineering">Security Engineering</a>, 
					</p>
					<p>
						They will also let you know about what they are learning in the ever changing
						section of the Security field they are working in. Once you have tried to take
						the current Security Risks seriously by being vulnerable with others in the field, perhaps
						you would like to learn more about the corporate security business. In Vancouver
						there is a Security Special Interest Group(SIG) for businesses called 
						<a href="http://www.infosecbc.org/">VanSecSig</a>, and if you find yourself 
						representing the businesses for the cause of security, this is a good place to 
						review (or help present) a variety relevant and/or interesting related topics.
