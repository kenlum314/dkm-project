						Implemented Features
					</h2>
					<p> 
						This page describes why we chose to design each of the components in the way that we did.
					</p>

					<h3>
						Lecture Navigation
					</h3>
					<p>
						Collapsible jQuery lecture navigation bar for navigation between lectures: We found that 
						we seldom wanted to navigate between lectures once we are in a particular lecture, so a 
						collapsible navigation bar makes sense to allow more space for the actual content of each 
						page.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article class="right">
					<h3 class="start_right">
						Content Navigation
					</h3>
					<p>
						Content navigation bar for navigating to the different anchors within each page. Students 
						would want to be able to quickly jump to the different subsections of a lecture. We chose 
						to make this navigation sidebar non-collapsible as we foresee it being used while a student 
						is viewing the current page:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Topical navigation sidebar</b>: Gives an overview of that particular lecture and 
								enables students to jump to a particular subtopic for quick reference.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Exercise navigation sidebar</b>: Enables a student to quickly navigate from one 
								exercise to the next when studying for quizzes and exams.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Homework assignment sidebar</b>: Often, a student will want to jump directly to 
								the homework assignment assigned for that lecture, so we thought having a dedicated 
								panel for the assignment will provide quick access to the assignment.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>
						Related Pages
					</h3>
					<p>
						The other pages such as the “Homepage,” “About the Course,” “Contact,” and “Resources/Links” 
						page, we decided to put them at the top of the page as a horizontal navigation bar in the header:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Anything that doesn’t need to be accessed often and for which there are few pages, we 
								decided to place at the top.
							</li>
							<li>
								Anything that pertains to actual course material, we decided to put at the sides and in 
								the middle where there is the most real estate.
							</li>
							<li>
								We also decided to keep the header thin (height-wise) to ensure content is not pushed 
								down too far when the user is at the top of the page.
							</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>
						Templating with SSIs
					</h3>
					<p>
						Common sections of code have been extracted and encapsulated into SSI’s to 
						facilitate future development and maintenance by cutting down on duplicate code.
					</p>
					<h3>
						SEO
					</h3>
					<p>
						The pages have meta description tags, a descriptive URL structure, and accurate section headings.

						Features for Future Consideration
					</h2>
					<p> 
						The scope for the current project could not include these features however we think they
						are a great idea for the course website, and should be considered in the future
					</p>

					<h3 class="start">
						Class Discussion Forum
					</h3>
					<p>
						A discussion forum would benefit not only students but the instructor as well. Frequently 
						asked questions answered here would cut down on the volume of email received by the 
						instructor asking the same questions. Integrating a third-party message board might be an 
						option here so that a database backend would not be required simply because of this feature.
					</p>
				</article>	
				<article class="right">
					<h3 class="start_right">
						Search Engine
					</h3>
					<p> 
						It is easy to incorporate Google Custom Search into almost any website.
					</p>

					<h3 class="start_right">
						Incorporate a CMS
					</h3>
					<p>
						Build the site dynamically by using templates and a CMS. That way, the instructor can enter 
						information through the GUI/WYSIWYG editor provided by the CMS instead of having to directly 
						author HTML files. Such a feature is not as important for a course such as COMP 1950 but 
						would be very important for courses in which the instructor is not as familiar with HTML. In 
						fact, enabling instructors with a nontechnical background to create content easily will open 
						up opportunities for this course website to be more generally applicable to any BCIT course.

					<h3>
						Mobile Friendly
					</h3>
					<p>
						Mobile-friendliness was not a top-priority as we assume that in the majority of cases students 
						would be accessing the site in a desktop computer or tablet browser since mobile screens are 
						not usually conducive for studying. Nevertheless, making the site mobile friendly should be at 
						least somewhat of a priority in the future.
